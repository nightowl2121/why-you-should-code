		<p>Coding has had an enormous impact on our modern world. It has dramatically influenced the twenty-first's century's culteral period and way
      of life, promoting an unprecented spread of information and thought.</p>
      <p> With the rise of the Internet, coding grew in importance and variety. The Internet Age prompted a massive developement into advanced
       coding, with many intelligent people pushing the boundaries of the science.</p>

			 <p><b>Social Impacts</b></p> <!--Style w/ CSS-->
			 <table cellpadding = "10">
			 	<td><p>Supported by coding, the Internet has led to a major influx in ideas and lifestyles spreading.
 				 Many countries, in particular America, now experience a blend of different ethnic cultures.
 				 This often provides them a more connected sense of identity.</p>

					 <td><p> Coding has a massive impact on social media, which in turn has largely broken distance and langauge borders and barriers between
						 citizens of the world. It has produced an increased range of shared ideas, beliefs, news, traditions, and cultural ways of life.</p>

 <hr>
  <p> In addition, it's contribution to furthering the developement of enterntainment, like gaming. Gaming has improved greatly from the times
		of simple programs like Pong. Now, gamers can play both online and off on homeconsoles, often with very little difference in graphics. A
		particularly clear example of the direct impact of coding to technology, gaming also is a huge source of modern enterntainment.</p>

						 <p>As is obvious, coding has affected the rise of technology massively, therefore influencing the culteral period we now live in <body>
						 	changing the trends in worldview, awareness of news, and even contributing to people's identity.</p>

							<p><b>Economic Impacts</b></p> <!--Style w/ CSS-->
							<table cellpadding = "10">
							<td><img src = "money.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" /></td>
						<td><p>Coding has produced an easier way of doing many things, from communication to increasing developement in significant industries
							such as machinery.As an impact of this new ease, the production costs has dramatically decreased, with things like the manufacturing and delivery improvements
								reducing fincancial fees tremendously.</p></td>
							</table>
							<p> By consequence, not only has production and simple access to news spread, it's radical cheapness lessened the burden on
								both the average consumer and the national and international markets as a whole.</p>
 <hr>
								<p><b>Military Impact</b></p> <!--Style w/ CSS-->
								<p>Due to the rise in technology prompted by the advancement in coding, the military now has progressive and destructive weapons
									that can operate without risking the safety of a human being.</p>
 <hr>
 <table cellpadding = "10">
	 <td><p>Robots, which operate nigh solely on code are a massive category in the military's arsenal. Now,
	 									with state of the art coding, robots are programmed to do a number of incredible, specific things, such as intelligence
	 									scouting and bombings.</p></td>

 <table cellpadding = "10">
 <td><img src = "roomba.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" /></td>
	 <td><p>Drones are often quickly being integrated into daily modern life. With robots to lift and inventory things in
 		warehouses and even the now popular Roomba to clean the floors of normal citizens. All of this incredible
 		progress is accredited to the intriguing science of coding.</p></td>
